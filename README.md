# Resume Optimizer: ATS Compatibility, Skill Gap Analysis, and Readability Improvement

## Overview

**Resume Optimizer** is a Python script designed to help you enhance your resume by optimizing it for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), performing a skill gap analysis, and improving readability. This tool extracts relevant keywords and skills from multiple job descriptions, compares them against your resume, and provides actionable recommendations to increase your chances of getting noticed by recruiters and hiring managers.
